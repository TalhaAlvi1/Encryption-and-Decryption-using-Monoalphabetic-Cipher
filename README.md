# Monoalphabetic Cipher in Java

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of encryption and decryption using a monoalphabetic cipher in Java. A monoalphabetic cipher maps each letter in the plaintext alphabet to a unique letter in the ciphertext alphabet.

## Project Overview

This Java program performs encryption and decryption without using any additional libraries or complex functions. It provides a basic understanding of how monoalphabetic substitution ciphers work, making it an excellent resource for beginners interested in cryptography.

## Features

- **Encrypts plaintext** using a predefined substitution alphabet.
- **Decrypts ciphertext** back to plaintext.
- Keeps non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) unchanged.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MonoalphabeticCipher
   cd MonoalphabeticCipher
